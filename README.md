# Engineering-Semester-2-Final-Project
This project was assigned at the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic, and while at first the goal was to design a Lego robot and program it to navigate a 'warehouse' and pick up boxes, this was not possible due to the lockdown restrictions in place (There were no in-person classes).

Instead, our assigned project was to make a simulated 'robot' navigate a factory and do the aforementioned task with Python. I wrote the simulation as well as the robot logic in this project as my solution to the problem
