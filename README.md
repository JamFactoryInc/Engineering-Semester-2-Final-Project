# Engineering-Semester-2-Final-Project
This project was assigned at the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic, and while at first the goal was to design a Lego robot and program it to navigate a 'warehouse' and pick up boxes, this was not possible due to the lockdown restrictions in place (There were no in-person classes).

Instead, our assigned project was t
o make a simulated 'robot' navigate a factory and do the aforementioned task with Python. I wrote the simulation as well as the robot logic in this project as my solution to the problem

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
Have a simulated robot get boxes with barcodes and deposit them into the correct depots in the 4 corners of the factory
The robot may not access its location data
The robot does not know the location or bar code of any box unless:
The robot is within proximity of a box to scan it and identify its bar code
There are randomly-placed obstructions that the robot must detect and successfully navigate around
Warehouse simulation must include 8 shelves each with two boxes
The robot must be able to move a box and deposit it in a depot

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:
Explanation video less than 15MB (This was due to the platform. I spoke very quickly)
