# Engineering-Semester-2-Final-Project
This project was assigned at the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic, and while at first the goal was to design a Lego robot and program it to navigate a 'warehouse' and pick up boxes, this was not possible due to the lockdown restrictions in place (There were no in-person classes).

Instead, our assigned project was to make a simulated 'robot' navigate a factory and do the aforementioned task with Python. I wrote the simulation as well as the robot logic in this project as my solution to the problem
An example simulation was provided, and while we were allowed to use it, I opted to write my own from scratch using the same visual library

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
Have a simulated robot get boxes with barcodes and deposit them into the correct depots in the 4 corners of the factory
The robot may only access its location data up to 3 times using what is called an IPS; Internal Positioning System
The robot does not know the location or bar code of any box unless:
The robot is within proximity of a box to scan it and identify its bar code
There are randomly-placed obstructions that the robot must detect and successfully navigate around


SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:
Explanation video less than 15MB (This was due to the platform. I spoke very quickly)
Explanation video must explain how each of the project requirements were met
Explanation video must give a reason why your solution is the best solution
